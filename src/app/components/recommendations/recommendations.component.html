<h3>Content Recommendations</h3>

<p>There is so much content out there in the modern day, but here is a tiny subset of those that immediately spring to mind that I think you would like.</p>

<p>I have also started a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/188204098-daniel-mcnally" target="_blank">Goodreads profile</a> to try and keep better track of what I have read, and some notes on what I have learnt. You may find some interesting books on there!</p>
